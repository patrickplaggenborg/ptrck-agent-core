# =============================================================================
# GLOBAL SETUP (Optional)
# =============================================================================
# To make variables available across ALL workspaces (Claude Code, Conductor),
# add exports to ~/.zshenv instead of this file:
#
#   export VARIABLE_NAME="value"
#
# ~/.zshenv is loaded by all zsh shells (interactive and non-interactive).
# Use this for personal credentials you don't want to repeat per-project.
