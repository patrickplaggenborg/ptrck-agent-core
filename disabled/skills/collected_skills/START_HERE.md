## What You Have

**13 carefully curated skills** that teach you:
1. How to create skills (3 meta-skills)
2. How to maintain quality (3 Iron Laws + 2 support skills)
3. How to orchestrate agents (5 orchestration skills)

**Sources**: Anthropic official + Superpowers methodology + Community SDK

## First Steps (Do This Now)

### 1. Read the Overview
📖 [README.md](README.md) - Understand what's in this collection and why

### 2. Follow the Learning Path
📋 [NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md) - Phase-by-phase learning guide (~2.5 hours)

### 3. Keep This Handy
🔍 [SKILLS_INDEX.md](SKILLS_INDEX.md) - Quick reference for all 13 skills

## The 3 Things You Must Learn First

### 1. Read These Meta-Skills (45 min)
These teach you HOW to create skills:
- [skill-creator](skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md) - Anthropic's official approach
- [mcp-builder](skills/mcp-builder/SKILL.md) - Building MCP servers
- [writing-skills](skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md) - TDD for skills

**Why**: You can't build good skills without understanding these patterns.

### 2. Internalize These Iron Laws (30 min)
These prevent quality erosion:
- **NO CODE WITHOUT TEST FIRST** - [test-driven-development](skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md)
- **NO CLAIMS WITHOUT VERIFICATION** - [verification-before-completion](skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md)
- **NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE** - [systematic-debugging](skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md)

**Why**: These laws exist because we all try to skip steps. Don't.

### 3. Understand Agent Orchestration (35 min)
These coordinate multiple agents:
- [writing-plans](skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md) - Break work into tasks
- [subagent-driven-development](skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md) - Execute with subagents
- [dispatching-parallel-agents](skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md) - Parallelize work

**Why**: This IS agent swarm orchestration. This is the core.

## Quick Win

**Your first task** (after reading meta-skills):

1. Adapt [using-superpowers](skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md) to `using-ptrck-agent-core`
2. This teaches the entry protocol pattern
3. Takes ~15 minutes
4. Gives you hands-on experience with skill customization

---

## Philosophy in 3 Sentences

1. **Anthropic's meta-skills** teach you structure and organization
2. **Superpowers' Iron Laws** prevent quality erosion through discipline
3. **Together** they create a foundation for reliable agent swarms

---

## What Makes This Different

Most skill collections are just tools. This is a **methodology** backed by:
- ✅ Official Anthropic patterns (skill-creator, mcp-builder)
- ✅ Battle-tested discipline (Superpowers Iron Laws)
- ✅ Explicit rationalization prevention
- ✅ Both structure AND quality approaches

---

## Don't Make These Mistakes

❌ Skipping the meta-skills and jumping to code
❌ Violating Iron Laws "just this once"
❌ Adding every skill you find
❌ Creating skills without testing them first

✅ Read meta-skills FIRST
✅ Internalize the Iron Laws
✅ Keep this core lean
✅ Test skills with actual agents

---

## Success Looks Like

After ~2.5 hours of reading:

- ✅ You can explain both skill-creator and writing-skills approaches
- ✅ You can recite the 3 Iron Laws without looking
- ✅ You know when to use each orchestration pattern
- ✅ You've adapted using-superpowers to using-ptrck-agent-core
- ✅ You're ready to create your first domain-specific skill
